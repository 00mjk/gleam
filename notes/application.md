## Talk title:

Build Your Own Elixir


## Talk abstract:

A journey through the process of creating a language that compiles to the
Erlang virtual machine.


## Talk objectives:

* Get a high level overview of the common parts of a compiler.
* Learn how to use Leex and Yacc to turn our source code file into an abstract
  syntax tree.
* See how we can generate Core Erlang from our abstract syntax tree and then
  load it into the VM.


## Target audience:

Developers with with an interest in how Elixir and other BEAM languages are
created. Some knowledge of Erlang syntax may be beneficial.
